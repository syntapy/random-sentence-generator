PREFACE


In preparing this history, I have been ably assisted by Lieut.-Col.
Eben P. Stanwood, Hon. E. J. Sherman and the notes prepared by the
late Wm. H. Bartlett. To these surviving comrades, I extend my warmest
thanks.

INTRODUCTORY


I have undertaken to write a history of the Forty-eighth Regiment,
Massachusetts Volunteers, in the Civil War in diary form from the
commencement to the close of the service. Undoubtedly much more might
have been written giving many interesting particulars concerning the
different companies and incidents relating to individual members of
those companies, but I have thought best to write a modest, true and
valuable presentation of the main features of the services rendered by
the regiment to the Government. It is not an easy task to write such a
history as will please everybody. I hope my efforts will be reasonably
and charitably considered by my comrades.

FORTY-EIGHTH REGIMENT M. V. M.


Few men in the North previous to April 12, 1861, thought that the men
of the South would be so rash as to precipitate a war between the two
sections, and when on that day the news flashed over the wires that the
Southern fire-eaters had fired upon Fort Sumter, and that the national
ensign had been pulled down, a great wave of horror and indignation
swept over the land. A call for 75,000 men for three months’ service
was issued by President Lincoln on the fifteenth day of April, 1861.

Many persons who considered themselves wise, pronounced the number too
great, and to most people it did seem to be a vast army--three times
greater than the whole regular army previous to that time. But little
actual fighting was done by the regiments furnished under this call,
but subsequently other calls were made for volunteers to serve for
three years or during the war.

On August 4, 1862, President Lincoln issued orders for a draft of
300,000 men for nine months’ service, but leave was granted to Governor
Andrew to fill the quota of Massachusetts by volunteers, and it
was in answer to this call that the men who later became the 48th
Massachusetts Infantry were recruited. It was the intention (and great
efforts were made by the gentlemen interested in its formation) to
make this an exclusively Essex County regiment, but the exigencies of
the war made it imperative that all regiments in process of formation
should be immediately sent to the front, and for this reason several
partially formed regiments were consolidated, and sent forward.

The regiments sent from Massachusetts under this call were designated
as follows:--

3d, Col. Silas Richmond; 4th, Col. Henry Walker; 5th, Col. George H.
Pierson; 6th, Col. Albert Follansbee; 8th, Col. Frederick J. Coffin;
42d, Col. Isaac S. Burrill; 43d, Col. Charles S. Holbrook; 44th,
Col. Francis L. Lee; 45th, Col. Charles R. Codman; 46th, Col. George
Bowler; 47th, Col. Lucius B. Marsh; 48th, Col. Eben F. Stone; 49th,
Col. William F. Bartlett; 50th, Col. Carlos P. Messer; 51st, Col.
Augustus B. R. Sprague; 52d, Col. Halbert S. Greenleaf; 53d, Col. John
W. Kimball, and the 11th Battery, Capt. Edward J. Jones, which was the
only battery of nine months’ men raised in the Commonwealth.

Of these regiments, the 3d, 5th, 6th, 8th, 43d, 44th, 45th, 46th, and
51st, served their time on the Eastern coast; the 4th, 42d, 47th,
48th, 49th, 50th, 52d, and 53d served in the Army of the Gulf, on the
Mississippi River; the 11th Battery served in the Army of the Potomac.

During the month of September, 1862, the men being recruited for the
Essex County regiment began to rendezvous in “Camp Lander,” Wenham,
Mass., and the Hon. Eben F. Stone, a prominent lawyer of Newburyport,
was appointed “Commandant of Camp.”

Barracks had been provided for two or more regiments, wells sunk, and
every arrangement made for the comfort of the men, several partially
formed companies of which came into camp during the month and were
mustered into the U. S. service as soon as they were recruited to a
minimum number.

Not much of special importance occurred to disturb the regular routine
of camp life while here, the days being spent in actively drilling and
becoming acquainted with the duties of a soldier; but occasionally
some little break would be made in the monotony of camp life; it
seems that there had grown up a feeling of jealousy among some of
the officers of another regiment in the camp, because Mr. Stone
had been appointed Commandant of Camp from civil life, and without
previous military training, when there were other officers in camp
who had had such training in the Volunteer Militia, and on October
24 the dissatisfaction culminated in an assault upon Capt. Stone’s
headquarters with bricks and other missiles, and for a time matters
assumed rather a warlike aspect, but finally settled down with but very
little bloodshed.

The quota of Massachusetts under this call was 19,090 men. The great
numbers already in the field and the fact that the last previous call
of July 2, for 300,000 men for three years’ service had not been
entirely filled, made it more difficult to secure these additional men
but the officers worked with a will, and soon no doubt was felt that
the object would be attained, and the call promptly answered. The first
company to secure the requisite number of recruits was the company
from Newburyport under command of Capt. Stone, which was mustered
September 16, and from that time forward companies were mustered as
they obtained the requisite number of men, until about November 1,
when there were about 750 men in camp, distributed in eight different
companies.

On the day previous to Thanksgiving Day the several companies were
furloughed to go home to spend Thanksgiving, to report again in camp
Saturday morning; only one company reported in accordance with orders,
and as no other company put in an appearance, the Captain gave his men
leave to return home, but to report again Monday morning, which they
did, as did the other companies, only to feel a little chagrined to
find that Adjt. Gen. Schouler, with a part of his staff, had visited
the camp on Sunday, and was very angry to find the camp deserted by all
but one Lieutenant and just enough men for camp guard. His remarks were
reported to have been very forcible, succinct and pithy, the air was
said to have been lurid.

He said, “By God! I’ll send this regiment South or to Hell!” and the
men concluded that they hadn’t much preference as to the two locations.
As a compromise between, the regiment was ordered to move to Camp
Meigs, at Readville, Mass., forthwith; but expecting to be sent to one
of the aforementioned places later on.

December 4, the regiment broke camp at Wenham and left for Camp Meigs.
While marching through Boston at the intersection of Washington
and Boylston Streets, the two companies from Lawrence, commanded
respectively by Capts. Colby and Rollins left, being transferred to
the 4th Regiment which had been recruiting at Lakeville, Mass., thus
filling up that regiment, and the unorganized 55th Irish Regiment,
which had been also recruiting at Lakeville was brought to Readville,
and merged with the remaining six companies from Wenham, which
completed the organization of this regiment, thus disposing of all
expectation of an Essex County regiment.

All the officers of the Wenham companies petitioned the Governor to
allow the Lawrence companies to remain as formerly connected. They were
a fine body of men and officers, and, being in the same camp together
so long, a strong attachment had sprung up between the different
companies; but the request was denied. The men and officers in the
Irish regiment were also much dissatisfied, and there were a great many
desertions, which (it was said) were encouraged by their officers;
a large number of the latter resigned and others were summarily
discharged. They had volunteered with the understanding that they were
to form an Irish regiment, and they were very indignant that that
arrangement was not carried out.

The accession of these new men having given the regiment the necessary
number of men, on December 6 an election for field officers was held,
and the regiment became the 48th Regiment of Massachusetts Infantry.

Capt. Eben F. Stone of Newburyport was elected Colonel, Mr. James
O’Brien of Charlestown was elected Lieutenant-Colonel, and Capt. George
Wheatland of Salem was elected Major.

The companies were designated as follows:--Co. A, from Newburyport and
vicinity; Co. B, from West Newbury and vicinity; Co. C, from Salisbury
and vicinity; Co. D, from Newbury and vicinity; Co. E, from Salem and
vicinity; Co. F, at large; Co. G, at large; Co. H, from Lowell; Co. I,
at large; Co. K, at large.

The line officers were as follows:--Co. A, Capt. Woodward, Lieuts.
Lawrie and Morrison; Co. B, Capt. Stanwood, Lieuts. Rollins and
Merrill; Co. C, Capt. Pettengill, Lieuts. Currier and Schoff; Co. D,
Capt. Noyes, Lieuts. Lord and Wilson; Co. E, Capt. Howes, Lieuts.
Sanders and Lee; Co. F, Capt. Sherman, Lieuts. Noyes and Burnett;
Co. G, Captain (vacant), Lieuts. Rudderham and O’Brien; Co. H, Capt.
Rogers, Lieuts. Frawley and Maginness; Co. I, Capt. McGuire, Lieuts.
Smith and Reade; Co. K, Capt. Todd, Lieuts. Clark and Bellen.

December 22. Capt. McGuire of Co. I was discharged and on the 26th
Lieut. Smith was promoted to fill the vacancy. This evening Edward
Galligher of Co. H was shot dead by Lieut. Lord of Co. D, Provost
Marshal, while drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest and assaulting
the Marshal.

The regiment remained in Camp Meigs until December 27 actively drilling
and the raw recruits getting whipped into shape for active duty in the
field, but this morning orders were received to break camp and leave
for New York and the South (or the other place previously alluded
to) and the regiment left at an hour’s notice, proceeding by rail to
Groton, Conn., where they went on board the Sound steamer for New
York arriving there at an early hour in the morning of the 28th and
going at once on board the “Constellation,” an old sailing vessel,
just arrived from Europe with a load of immigrants. It had not been
properly cleansed and was very foul and dirty; but it is a soldier’s
duty to bear with all sorts of inconveniences, and we soon learned to
accept them without an undue amount of grumbling. There was no chance
for a fire on board except in the first cabin, consequently the line
officers, who occupied the second cabin, and the enlisted men who were
quartered between decks, suffered considerably with the cold, but we
were consoled with the thought that if we were destined for either
of the places threatened by Gen. Schouler we should not be likely to
grumble on account of cold weather.

Friday, January 2, got under way at 12.30 P. M., being towed out by tug
“Rattler,” which cast off and left us at 4.15, taking ashore a large
mail for friends left at home.

January 8 we arrived off the mouth of Chesapeake Bay with little of
special importance transpiring. Pilot came on board at 9.30 A. M. and
we passed up the bay where we found many of the fleet composing the
“Banks Expedition” of which we now find the 48th is a part, and came
to anchor just below and near Fortress Monroe where we remained till
January 15, when under sailing orders the tug hitched on again and we
sailed away South at 2.30 P. M. in a gale of wind. The voyage South
lasted until the 30th day of January during which the deadly ship fever
(the surgeons call it “Purpura”) broke out on board and several of our
men died from its effects and received a soldier’s burial at sea.

It is a sad sight to see the poor fellows launched into the deep dark
waves, while their comrades stand nigh with anxious tearful faces.
The fever increasing rapidly the men all came upon deck, the hatches
battened down and the ship thoroughly fumigated.

The following letter is self-explanatory:

  On board Ship “Constellation,”
  in Gulf of Mexico,
  January 24, 1863.

 My dear Madam:--I have sad news to communicate. Your son is no more
 on this earth. He was taken ill last Wednesday, and, in less than
 twenty-four hours, he was a corpse. He died at four o’clock P. M.,
 on Thursday and was buried at sunset in the Gulf Stream off coast of
 Florida, Latitude 25, Longitude 20 west.

 Let me assure you that everything possible was done for him, by his
 comrades and our good surgeon, Dr. Hurd, to save him from ravages
 of ship fever, but all our efforts were in vain. The light of his
 youthful countenance has gone out forever.

 What can I say to you, his good mother, who gave her only son an
 offering upon the altar of our common country?

 A fond mother will desire the sad details, his last acts and words. An
 hour before he died, I told him the doctor feared he could not live.
 He seemed to be fully aware of his condition, and, turning his head
 toward me he said, “Tell mother I should rather have died fighting the
 battles of my country, but God’s will be done.” Very soon he drew his
 blanket over him and calmly sank into the arms of death, like one “who
 wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies down to pleasant
 dreams.”

 His last thoughts were of his mother and he died lamenting only his
 inability to do more for his country.

 He was a mere boy in age and looks but he had the judgment of an older
 patriot.

 There are many creeds which will tell you that your son has not gone
 to happiness or Heaven. He lived an honest life, but died according to
 those creeds “unconverted.”

    “The upright, honest-hearted man,
      Who strives to do the best he can,
    Need never fear the Church’s ban
      Or Hell’s damnation;
    For God will need no special plan,
      For His salvation.”

 He died full of faith and hope, with a belief that he had done his
 whole duty to his country and his God. And I believe, in the language
 of the Mayor of our goodly city, “He was a soldier in a good cause,
 and at the command of the Supreme Governor, he has laid down his arms
 and gone up higher. Watchworn and weary, he has laid his armor off and
 rests in Heaven. The everlasting gates of fame have lifted up their
 heads and he has passed through to imperishable renown. The portals of
 history have been thrown wide open and he has marched in a hero.”

 Think then of your darling boy, not as dead but as having gone over to
 the majority in Heaven.

 Permit me, my dear madam, to mingle my tears in sympathy with yours in
 this hour of your great affliction. May God bless and comfort you, I
 am,

  Sincerely your friend,
  EDGAR J. SHERMAN, Captain.


Captain Sherman, after returning home, was met by the clergyman who
officiated at the funeral of the young soldier, who said, “Captain, I
read your letter at the funeral, and I do not think there was a dry
eye in the audience.” “But,” said the Captain, “did you not regard the
poetry as heretical?” “You were fully justified,” said the clergyman,
“in writing anything you could to comfort that poor heart-broken
mother. But who knows that he died unconverted? Were not his last
words, ‘God’s will be done?’”

In passing Cape Hatteras we experienced a fierce storm, but the old
ship floundered safely along through the boiling sea with but little
serious damage. The violent motion of the ship and the corresponding
and sympathetic motion of our stomachs reminded us forcibly of the old
bass aria in Haydn’s Oratorio of “The Creation,” “Rolling in foaming
billows uplifted roars the boisterous sea.” Except these and a few
minor incidents the voyage was uneventful.

The vacancy in Captain’s office in Co. G was filled on January 15 by
appointment of Lieut. Schoff to that company as Captain.

On looking at the map of the United States we observe that the State of
Louisiana lies on both sides of the Mississippi River and that the
States of Arkansas and Mississippi lay on the right and left banks of
that great stream, 500 miles of whose lower course was thus controlled
during the first year of the Civil War by those three States unitedly
inhabited by hardly as many white people as the city of New York.

[Illustration: INSIDE REBEL BREASTWORKS,

Port Hudson, La., After Surrender, July 8, 1863.]

[Illustration: CEMETERY BATTERY,

Baton Rouge, La., Looking Toward Port Hudson.]

If we observe then the course drained by that river and its
tributaries, commencing with Missouri on its right bank and Kentucky
on its left bank, we find it to consist of eight or nine large States,
large portions of three or four others, and several large Territories,
in all a country as large as Europe, as fine as any under the sun,
holding at the commencement of the war more people than all the
revolted States and destined to become one of the most populous and
powerful regions on the face of the globe.

If any at the opening of the war supposed that those powerful States,
comprising a great and energetic population, would ever consent to a
peace that would put the lower course of that great national outlet to
the sea in the hands of a foreign power far weaker than themselves,
they were blind indeed to the lessons of history.

The people of Kentucky alone before they were constituted a State gave
formal notice to the Federal Government that if the United States did
not conquer Louisiana they would conquer it themselves. In the words
of a distinguished citizen of that martial State: “The mouths of the
Mississippi belong by the gift of God to the inhabitants of its great
valley. Nothing but irresistible force can disinherit them.”

Akin to this was the feeling of the men of the Northwest at the
outbreak of the Civil War. With them the opening of the Mississippi was
an absorbing passion and they entered on that enterprise with alacrity
and with a grim determination not to cease from their efforts until
that great river which forms a part of the life and very existence of
the West should be repossessed, and the insulted ensign of the Republic
planted on the last battlements of the Rebellion.

By the Summer of 1863, after many a bloody fight on the river and on
the land, they had reached Vicksburg, and Grant had drawn his lines of
investment around that stronghold. Meantime their brethren of the East
had ascended the river from its mouth and had taken possession of all
the rebel defences on the lower Mississippi. Subsequently Farragut,
being away on the Gulf coast, the rebels seized the opportunity to
fortify and garrison Port Hudson, in Louisiana. There remained then at
the opening of the Summer of ’63 these two strongholds, Vicksburg and
Port Hudson, the retention of which was necessary to the Confederates
if they would maintain their hold on the Mississippi.

Both parties to the struggle realized the importance of these
positions. Jefferson Davis, while on a visit to Mississippi to inspect
the defences of Vicksburg, spoke as follows in a speech at Jackson
before the Mississippi Legislature: “Vicksburg and Port Hudson are
the real points of attack. Every effort will be made to capture these
places with the object of forcing the navigation of the Mississippi
and severing the eastern from the western portion of the Confederacy.
Let all then who have at heart the welfare and safety of the country
go without delay to Vicksburg and Port Hudson. Let them go for thirty
or sixty or ninety days. Let them assist in preserving the Mississippi
River, that great artery of our country, and thus conduce more than in
any other way to the perpetuation of the Confederacy and the success of
our cause.”

Most people probably have a tolerably clear idea of Grant’s campaign
against Vicksburg. As the history of the 48th Regiment is inseparably
connected with the siege and capture of Port Hudson, it is proper that
at this point some description of that place and its defences should be
given.

Port Hudson is situated on a bend on the eastern side of the
Mississippi about twenty-two miles north of Baton Rouge, and 147 miles
from New Orleans. It is 300 miles below Vicksburg. The bluff rising
abruptly some forty feet above the surface of the river was covered
with fortifications for a space of nearly four miles, constructed
upon the most scientific principles of military art and armed with
the heaviest and most approved guns which England could furnish the
Confederates.

The river as it approaches the bend suddenly narrows and the current
striking the west bank is thrown across with great velocity and carries
the channel almost directly under the precipitous cliffs. Any vessel
attempting the passage would be compelled to run the gauntlet of a
plunging fire from the batteries which commanded the river for several
miles above and below. Thus it will be seen that on the river side the
position was so fortified by nature and art that it was practically
impregnable.

On the land side it was scarcely less so. There it was protected by a
high parapet extending some seven or eight miles in a semi-circle from
river to river, in front of which was a ditch from ten to twelve feet
wide and six feet deep. Along nearly the whole line in front of this
ditch and extending from half a mile to a mile from it was formerly a
heavy growth of timber. This had all been cut down; so that in every
direction the fallen tops of trees interlaced, trunks blocked up every
passage and brambles were growing over the whole. Moreover, the space
where this forest had stood was cut up in every direction by gullies
and ravines, all containing more or less fallen timber. Under favorable
circumstances, that is with a good supply of ammunition and provisions,
and a garrison of 20,000 men, Port Hudson could have resisted any force
that could have been brought against it.

The task of taking this stronghold fell to the lot of the Army of the
Gulf, consisting mainly of the 19th Army Corps, to which the 48th M. V.
M. was attached.

Two o’clock in the morning of Jan. 30, 1863. The old ship
Constellation, bearing the 48th Regiment, is lying off the southwest
pass of the Mississippi River and is throwing up rockets as a signal
for a pilot. Presently a tug comes steaming out from the river and as
daylight is breaking we leave the muddy waters of the gulf behind us,
not, however, without the assistance of a second powerful tug to take
us over the bar, and enter the still muddier waters of the Mississippi.
For some miles the river presents no objects of interest. Low marshy
shores covered with coarse sedges, fit haunts for alligators and other
venomous reptiles--in all about as uninviting a place as can well
be imagined. Towards noon we reach the famous Forts Jackson and St.
Philip, one of which gives us a salute as we pass.

They were occupied at this time by the 26th Massachusetts Regiment
who cheered us lustily as we passed. At 9 o’clock A. M., January 31,
arrived at quarantine where the ship was boarded by the health officer,
who discovered no reason to detain us, although so very recently having
been scourged by the ship fever, and he declared us “all right” and
gave us a clean bill.

The only evidence of the desperate fight of the year before when
Farragut ran the gauntlet of these forts are the remnants of several
rebel gunboats which were destroyed during the fight and driven as
high as possible on the banks of the river, and the Union sloop-of-war
Varuna, which lay on the bottom of this river with only the tops of
her masts out of water. After passing the forts, as we approach New
Orleans the country becomes somewhat more interesting. We pass some
fine plantations with stately mansions, large sugar houses and long
rows of cabins, the habitations of the blacks. Much of the way we
run close to the bank and as we turn bend after bend in the river we
are tantalized by the sight of orange groves laden with the luscious
fruit--so near and yet so far. We see very few white men. Most of
them have doubtless gone into the rebel army. Now and then a planter
standing on the bank gazes at us sullenly as we pass. It seemed evident
that they were not over-pleased to see us. Our only welcome was from
the negroes. Their shouts from the levee, accompanied by laughter and
frantic gesticulations, bespoke their joy. One white man, bolder than
his fellows, shouted the inquiry: “What regiment is that?” and being
informed he imparted the cheerful information that we had come all the
way from Massachusetts to find our graves--a prophecy which proved true
of many a boy on board that ship.

February 1, Sunday, at 3 A. M., we reached New Orleans and anchored
opposite the central part of the city, where we remained during the
next day. Looking at New Orleans at that time, it was hard to realize
that just previous to the opening of the war it had the largest export
trade of any city in the world. Its stores closed, its fine business
blocks deserted, its levee which had once groaned with the burden
of a great commerce empty and desolate, the great metropolis of the
Southwest lying under the guns of our ships of war was a mute but vivid
witness of the folly of rebellion.

Leaving New Orleans on the 3rd at 11.45 A. M. we proceeded up the
river. Above New Orleans the desolation became more marked. War had
written his autograph over the whole face of the country. Crops of
sugar cane which should have yielded thousands of pounds of sugar were
still standing in February, when they should have been gathered months
before. No hope of saving them, for the frost had been at work upon
them. Moreover, the planter’s negroes had left him, his horses had been
stolen, his mules and teams confiscated by the Government. Defiant
amid the general wreck, the planters were said to be bitterly cursing
President Lincoln and praying for the destruction of the Union armies.

The village of Donaldson, the first place of importance above New
Orleans, presented a sorry sight. Its inhabitants had had the bad habit
of firing on our weaker steamers as they passed up and down the river.
Farragut bore the outrage until forbearance ceased to be a virtue, and
then assured the people that if the outrage were again repeated he
would shell the town. It was again committed and Farragut, true to his
word, bombarded the place until only about half of the original town
was left.

Approaching Baton Rouge, 125 miles above New Orleans, on the morning of
the 4th, the first thing that attracted our attention was the ruined
Capitol of the State, grim and ghastly in the morning light. This fine
building was fired when our forces took possession of the town, by whom
will never be known. The rebels charged the Unionists with doing the
deed when they entered the place, and the Unionists as stoutly asserted
that it was the last act of the rebels before leaving. The magnificent
library, fine furniture and works of art were all destroyed. Only
Powers’ statue of Washington, the work of Northern genius, was rescued
from the flames.

Our steamer drew up to the levee at Baton Rouge just as the sweet notes
of the reveille were sounding from camp to camp, bugles echoing bugles,
fifes warbling, drums beating, while here and there from a distant camp
came the rich swell of a full band.

It was with the greatest delight that we disembarked, for we had
already learned what it was to suffer. Confined for six weeks on an old
hulk for which the Government was paying more every week than the ship
was worth, we had not escaped the ravages of disease. The transport on
which we had made the trip from New York had formerly been an emigrant
ship. The seeds of disease were lurking in her timbers. While we were
on the Atlantic a fatal disease--a spotted fever--broke out, and in a
few days several of our boys had fallen victims and were consigned to a
watery grave.

And now once again on terra firma our spirits rose accordingly, and
there was a general feeling of hopefulness and cheer in our ranks as
we marched over the bluff to a plain about two miles from the village,
where we pitched our tents on a spot which was to be our home for
several weeks. Our camping ground had once been occupied by the rebels
for the same purpose. It was a part of the field on which the battle
of the previous year had been fought. The trees in the vicinity still
showed the effects of the shot and fragments of shell, the bones of
animals and soldiers’ graves showed that our troops had gained no
bloodless victory.

Picket duty, guard duty, and the routine of drill was our life for
several weeks. The battlefield with its terrors had thus far kept aloof
but we were brought face to face with a chapter of army life hardly
less sad.

Though Baton Rouge and the country northward is much more healthful
than the fever level below, still there is no place in all that region
where one can lead the exposed life of a soldier with impunity. Many
of our most rugged men yielded to the fatal miasm with which the night
air is laden, and those who had never known a day’s sickness in their
lives went daily at the surgeon’s call to get their dose of quinine.
Death came and mustered out many. Funerals were of daily occurrence
and sometimes it seemed of almost hourly occurrence. The notes of the
dead march, the sad, sad wailing of the fife, the mournful throb of
the muffled drum, the march with downcast eyes and arms reversed, the
parting volley above the grave, and then the return march, quick time,
arms at the right shoulder, fifes warbling like birds in springtime,
and drums beating merrily--these sights and sounds were far too common.

Our sojourn at Baton Rouge was a period of waiting expectancy. We were
learning that to wait is one of the chief duties of a soldier as it is
indeed one of the most irksome.

On February 5 the regiment received a few old “Sibley” tents, a lot
which had been left behind by some departing regiment. They were musty
old things, but some of the boys went into them until our new ones,
which we are entitled to, should arrive. Today the 48th was brigaded
with the 116th New York, the 21st Maine and the 49th Massachusetts,
constituting the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, 19th Army Corps, with
Maj.-Gen. C. C. Augur--a regular army officer--in command of the
Division; Col. E. P. Chapin of the 116th New York (Senior Colonel) in
command of the Brigade, and Maj.-Gen. N. P. Banks in command of the
Department, which was designated as the “Department of the Gulf,” and
on February 6 muskets and ammunition were dealt out and we then for the
first time considered ourselves full-fledged soldiers of “Uncle Sam.”

On March 11 there was a grand review of the troops then at Baton
Rouge. The sight of 20,000 well-drilled troops, infantry, cavalry,
and artillery is no ordinary spectacle. Banks on his coal-black
stallion with his Division and Brigade Commanders made a distinguished
appearance, but the writer recalls that his interest centered chiefly
in Farragut who with the Captains of the fleet had been invited to
witness the parade.

At length on March 12 at 9 P. M. an order came to have twenty-four
hours cooked rations and forty rounds of ammunition and be ready to
march at a moment’s notice. At daybreak the next morning we marched
to the levee at Baton Rouge where we embarked on board a steamer and
sailed slowly up the river. Another regiment accompanied us and two
companies of cavalry. We had started on a reconnaissance. We were
convoyed by the famous gunboat Essex which kept a half a mile ahead of
us and occasionally threw a shell into the woods along the shore. We
disembarked a few miles below Port Hudson under cover of the guns of
the Essex. The road leading to the bluff a distance of a quarter of a
mile from the river, swollen by the spring freshets, was entirely under
water, in some places reaching nearly to the waists of the shorter men.
Wading through this the order of march was formed upon the bluff. The
cavalry went ahead, filling the road and stretching out over the fields
on either side. We approached within a few miles of the Confederate
works and drove in their pickets who left their posts so rapidly as
to leave their cooking utensils lying near the smouldering embers of
the fire where they had cooked their morning meal. Presently we came
upon a company of guerillas who fled to the woods, all but one young
fellow who was captured. At about noon, hot, tired and thirsty, we
halted for a brief rest at a plantation some sixteen miles from Baton
Rouge and I doubt if at any time or place during the great conflict
the confiscation law was more vigorously and thoroughly enforced.
Within a few minutes after our arrival the feathered inhabitants of
the plantation had nothing further to say. Our march from this place
to Baton Rouge was a rapid one. We were within a short distance of a
comparatively large and powerful army of the enemy and it was quite
within the bounds of possibility that a force might be sent out to
fall upon us before we could reach our camp. But the reconnaissance
on the whole was a success. The road was clear of rebels and about
five miles from Baton Rouge where the Montecino Bayou crosses the
road we met the division of General Cuvier Grover fresh from their
camp at Baton Rouge. No one who witnessed those regiments of infantry
and cavalry and the fine batteries accompanying them as they crossed
the pontoon bridge and came springing up the hillside, and with their
gun-barrels glistening in the rays of the setting sun disappeared from
view on the winding road ahead will ever lose the impression there
gained.

We reached our camp at Baton Rouge at about 9 o’clock. Most of us were
footsore and all were weary, and creeping into our tents we were just
settling down to a good night’s rest when down from headquarters came
an order to march at 3 the next morning. So in the early morning we
fell in each heavily laden with knapsack, a full supply of cartridges
and two days’ rations, and started on the road over which we had come
the previous day. The morning was cool, the road in good order, trees
just budding out and festooned with vines and moss. On the whole we
enjoyed the scenery of the Southern forest road and the fresh morning
air. Neither the heavy burdens nor the blistered feet caused by
yesterday’s weary march could wholly repress our enthusiasm, ignorant
as we were of campaign life and eager for a change. But as we got out
into the open country and old Sol rising higher and higher got in his
work upon us our burdens seemed heavier and heavier every moment and
every step was an agony. With rout step and arms at will, on, on we
plodded through clouds of dust. No wonder that some of the boys sank
by the side of the road exhausted, only to come up late in the evening
after the regiment had bivouacked. But the longest day and the weariest
march must have an end and as the shades of night were falling we
halted at a corn field where, after a hasty meal, we bivouacked for the
night. With knapsacks for pillows and the starry heavens for canopy
we lay along the ridges of the corn field and tired Nature’s sweet
restorer, balmy sleep, soon came to our relief.

The writer remembers being hastily awakened after a few hours sleep by
the comrade by his side who said, “Look up over the trees!” and there
we could easily trace the course of the shells from Farragut’s mortar
boats and could hear their dull, explosive thud as they fell inside the
works at Port Hudson. But even that display of fireworks interested
us but for a moment. Soon we were again sleeping soundly unconscious
of the tumult on the river. Shortly after midnight the cry, “fall in”
passed along the lines and slinging knapsacks and shouldering rifles
we passed out of the field past the long, long lines of sleeping men
and were again on the march, this time away from Port Hudson. What
this movement meant we could not comprehend. Had disaster befallen the
fleet or our troops at the front? Were we beginning the retreat? All
was doubt and uncertainty. We stumbled along in the thick darkness
through the dense woods, the silence of which was broken only by an
occasional heavy booming sound from the river. The black darkness of
the night grew heavier and heavier. It was at that darkest hour just
before the dawn when all at once the entire heavens were aglow. An
instant flash of lights as bright as the brightest noonday penetrated
the inmost recesses of the forest and for a moment sharply outlined
every soldier’s form--then came a sound that shook the very earth,
that thundered and reverberated along the entire horizon--then all was
still and dark. “What is it?” was the question on every lip. Not until
morning had fully dawned did we learn that it was the dying cry of the
old warship Mississippi as she sank to her rest beneath the waters of
the river whence she had received her name.

The events of that memorable night form one of the most stirring
chapters of the history of the war. Farragut having learned of our loss
of the steamer Queen of the West between Vicksburg and Port Hudson
determined to run past the batteries at the latter place and recover
command of the river above. So in his stout flagship, the Hartford,
lashed side by side with the Albatross he led the perilous adventure
arriving abreast of the rebel works at about midnight. The rebels were
on the watch and immediately the flames of a vast bonfire in front of
the heaviest batteries lighting up the entire breadth of the river
shot up into the sky and the next instant the earth trembled to the
roar of all the rebel batteries, whereupon our mortar boats below
began firing thirteen-inch shell, and four frigates and five gunboats
moved up into the fight. As our ships came past within pistol shot
of the batteries grape and canister swept their decks with murderous
discharges, the crescent shape of the river enabling them to rake each
vessel as it approached and again as it receded. By 1 o’clock the fight
was virtually over, the Hartford and the Albatross having passed while
most of their consorts had failed and dropped down to their anchorage
below, when a fresh blaze told of a heavy loss. The Mississippi had run
aground directly abreast of the heaviest and most central battery where
her helpless plight was soon discovered and she at once became a target
for them all. Here Capt. Melancthon Smith fought her nearly half an
hour until she was completely riddled, when he ordered her set on fire
and abandoned, and she was burning ashore until she was so lightened
that she floated, when she drifted down the river a blazing ruin,
exploding several miles below when the fire had reached her magazine.

The morning after this memorable night found the 48th guarding a bridge
on a road parallel to the main road from Baton Rouge to Port Hudson. We
had fuel prepared ready in an emergency to burn the bridge as it was
feared the enemy’s cavalry might attempt to make a dash on the flank of
our army. No cavalry appeared, however, and we were soon withdrawn and
went into camp on the banks of the Montecino Bayou. And now the troops
came pouring back from Port Hudson. They had advanced to the outer
works, fired a few shots and retired. Not realizing that the movement
was but a feint intended to deceive the enemy in the hope that they
might withdraw some of their heavy guns from the bluff and thus make
easier the passage of the fleet, Bank’s soldiers showered curses on him
and his tactics. They grew calmer when he issued a proclamation saying
that the object of the expedition had been successfully accomplished.
A week later all the troops were withdrawn to Baton Rouge. Banks
with the larger part of the army left for an expedition in Western
Louisiana and our Division was left to garrison Baton Rouge. We took
up again the daily routine of picket duty, guard duty, and drill,
varied occasionally by a night alarm from the picket line when we
would hastily fall in in the darkness and prepare to meet an enemy
that did not come. Such was our life for two months. Its monotony was
broken on the 2d of May when Grierson with his troopers dusty, haggard
and wayworn, rode into Baton Rouge. The story of their coming and of
their incredible adventures flew like wild fire through the camps and
the excitement was at a high pitch. Nothing like it had been known
before in the war. Seventeen hundred men had ridden through the entire
length of the State of Mississippi from the northeast to the southwest
corner, encountering every conceivable danger and hardship. Thousands
of Confederates had been trying to find and intercept them. But with
matchless skill Grierson had escaped them by circuits, outwitted them
by ruses, and attacked and routed them with far inferior numbers. In
this raid of 600 miles through a country swarming with foes they had
cut two railroads, burned nine bridges, destroyed two locomotives
and nearly 200 cars, broken up three rebel camps, destroyed more
than $4,000,000 worth of Confederate government property, captured
and paroled 1,000 prisoners and brought in with them 1,200 captured
horses. Hundreds of dark-hued patriots accompanied them into Baton
Rouge mounted on mules and horses they had borrowed from their late
masters. Some idea of the pluck and endurance of the Westerners may be
obtained from the fact that during the twenty-eight hours preceding
their arrival at Baton Rouge they had marched more than sixty miles,
had four fights and crossed the Comite River where it was necessary to
swim their horses.

As the month of May wore away boat load after boat load of troops
arrived at Baton Rouge and it soon became evident that the long-looked
for movement against Port Hudson was at hand. The 48th received
marching orders on the 11th and on the 18th was again on the familiar
road to Port Hudson, starting on an expedition from which many in that
column were never to return.

That night we camped sixteen miles from Baton Rouge where we remained
until the 21st, on which day we received our baptism of fire. The
regiment got into line at an early hour and took up line of march for
Port Hudson. We had not moved a mile before the booming of guns ahead
announced that our advance had found the enemy and in all probability
we would soon be engaged.

On arriving at the intersection of the Bayou Sara and Port Hudson roads
near the “Plains Store,” so called, located at that point, the advance
was checked by shots from a rebel battery planted at the “store.” Col.
Dudley’s Brigade was in the advance and received the first shock; some
of his troops skirmished in front while others made a flank movement,
and the rebels were routed after quite a sharp engagement.

Lieut. Tucker of the Massachusetts 49th, acting on Col. Chapin’s staff,
lost a leg by cannon shot. After the battle was supposed to be over,
and the rebels had precipitately retired, the Division (excepting the
48th) made preparations to bivouac in the field at the right and left
of the Bayou Sara road near the “Plains Store.” A section of the 5th U.
S. Regular Battery was sent a short distance up the Port Hudson road
and the 48th Massachusetts was ordered to its support.

Col. Stone was informed that the Illinois cavalry were picketing on his
front and right, and the 174th New York infantry on his left, and he
was cautioned very strictly to be careful and not shoot those pickets
by mistake.

The Staff Officer who conducted the 48th to its position, led them
(and also the battery), entirely outside the pickets, so that unknown
to Col. Stone the 48th was in a very exposed position, with neither
front nor flanks protected. Cos. H and K were detached from the right
wing and sent to the rear to guard the baggage train, leaving only
three companies, B, E and D, in that wing; these three companies of
the right wing, under Lieut.-Col. O’Brien, filed into the woods on the
right hand side of the road; and the left wing, Cos. F, G, I, A and C,
with Col. Stone, into the woods on the left-hand side of the road, and
the battery was placed in the road between the two wings which were
entirely separated from each other. Scarcely had the regiment taken
its position when the rebels commenced shelling us and our battery
smartly returned their fire. While this was transpiring a force of
rebel infantry passed around the left flank, and to the rear of the
left wing, and as soon as the artillery fire ceased, fell upon them
while totally unprepared. The suddenness of the attack threw them into
confusion and they gave way and retreated to the rear. The advance of
the rebels was met by a countercharge of the 116th New York and the
rebels were routed.

A portion of the rebel forces crossed the road and came upon the
left flank and rear of the right wing. Lieut.-Col. O’Brien attempted
to change front by throwing back his left, but a portion of the men
became confused, and Col. O’Brien ordered a retreat. This order was
not heard by Capt. Stanwood. Seeing some of his men about to fall back
in disorder he ordered them to stand fast, which they did, and with
a portion of Cos. E and D fell back about 100 yards and took a new
position, rallying on the colors.

General Augur was at the rear and near the Plains Store and witnessed
the occurrence: The battery guns went to the rear before the right wing
left its position. Col. Stone lost both his horses, captured. At night
Co. B went on picket.

The 48th lost two killed, several wounded and prisoners in the fight
today.

May 22. Co. B was relieved from picket by Co. F. Calvin A. Farrington
of Co. B was missing at roll call, having been taken prisoner.
Lieut.-Col. O’Brien and Captain Stanwood were requested to come to
Maj.-Gen. Augur’s headquarters, which they did, and were complimented
very highly for the part sustained by the right wing in yesterday’s
battle; and also some of the officers and men of the left wing who
rallied on the colors. The numbers in the right wing were so few that
the General supposed at the time that there was but one company. He
said the regiment did as well as any but veteran troops would do under
the circumstances; that they had by mistake been placed in the wrong
position and were very badly posted on either side of the road. He
kindly criticised Lieut.-Col. O’Brien and told him that he made a
great mistake by trying to make a wheel to the rear in the face of an
aggressive enemy, his men being under fire for the first time; none but
seasoned troops could do that safely. He said the Lieutenant-Colonel
should have ordered the right of his command forward and met the
enemy, and taken the aggressive, and he had confidence, from what he
witnessed of their steadiness, that the men would have supported him.
He then complimented the men for coolness under fire and said no doubt
the regiment would feel chagrined at the outcome of their first battle,
but no doubt an early opportunity would be given them to retrieve
themselves. He also said that if the regiment should be called upon
for volunteers for an assaulting party, in a future assault (which he
thought would be the case very soon) he directed Captain Stanwood of
Co. B and his company not to feel as if called upon, but to remain
with the main body of the regiment, that he would not be expected to
volunteer in any forlorn hope or assaulting party. His 1st Lieut.
(Rollins) detailed to Col. Chapin’s staff. Lieut. Merrill was acting
Quartermaster of the regiment for some considerable time.

May 23. Alarm in the night--long roll beaten--regiment turned out under
arms, but the alarm proved to be false. 48th ordered far down to the
rear of the 1st Battery fight on the Bayou Sara road.

Co. E’s men proved themselves good foragers, bringing in quantities of
poultry and pigs.

May 24. Regiment ordered to march to the front with one day’s rations
at 6 o’clock A. M. Co. B was detached and sent forward skirmishing into
a narrow strip of woods; the mud and water were very deep and almost
impenetrable. They advanced, however, with great difficulty through the
woods to within about 300 yards of the rebel works and there remained
through the day, lying in the edge of the woods, and witnessed the
artillery battle between the opposing batteries in our immediate front
till nearly dark when they were relieved by the Massachusetts 49th.

May 25. There was a smart fight near night upon our right in Gen.
Grover’s Division and some rebs attempted to cut their way out but
failed and were taken prisoners. The regiment ordered to sleep on their
arms tonight.

May 26. One false alarm during the night. Regiment got into line
promptly, but as promptly dismissed. Orders received from headquarters
for volunteers for a “Forlorn Hope” to charge in advance of the brigade
line, and storm the enemy’s works tomorrow morning.

There were more than the required number came forward from the brigade
(the call was for 200 men from the brigade) and ninety-two men were
accepted from the 48th Massachusetts. The following are the names
of those accepted from the 48th: Lieut.-Col. O’Brien; Co. A, Capt.
Woodward, Lieut. Morrison, Privates E. C. Varina, N. F. Peabody, Isaac
F. Porter, Henry M. Cross; Co. C, Lieut. Emery; Co. D, Private J. F.
Kinsman; Co. E, Privates Geo. Wagner, John Lewis, H. Mansfield, Henry
Krone, J. F. Stoddard; Co. F, Lieut. Noyes, Privates Austin Smith,
George Bocock, P. Noonan, A. Mullins, John McDougal, J. P. Blanchard,
D. C. Morrill, E. J. Oakes; Co. G, Capt. Schoff; Co. H, Capt. Rogers,
Lieut. Frawley, Lieut. McGinness, Sergts. Thomas McLaughlin, John W.
Leyes, Richard Ward, Corporals Timothy Lehiffe, Robert Leach, James
Gildee, Daniel Desmond, Privates Michael Farley, Morrissey A. Hearn,
Joseph Burgess, John Boyle, John Bradley, Michael Bates, Patrick
Cullins, Patrick Dumey, Wm. Finnigan, James Gilogby, Matthew R.

Harding, Privates Daniel Crowley, Ed. Ryan, J. Gallagher, James Rand,
J. Keenan.

May 27. Before the men had had their breakfast orders were received
to assault the enemy’s works. Immediately we advanced quietly to
the extreme edge of the woods where we laid on our arms till about
2 o’clock in the afternoon, the “Forlorn Hope” under command of
Lieut.-Col. O’Brien in the advance. At that hour and before the main
line had fairly formed for the assault we received a volley from the
enemy’s guns and at the same time the zip of the rebel bullets was
getting unpleasantly frequent. General Augur, who stood very near,
seeing the men dodge their heads at the disagreeable sound said, “No
use boys to dodge them after you hear them,” a fact we soon learned
by experience. The “Forlorn Hope” had commenced the charge, O’Brien
saying, “Come boys! pick up your bundles and follow me,” and General
Augur gave the command, “Forward the Brigade,” and the whole brigade
advanced into the “slashings.” The whole forest of large trees and
small had been felled and the limbs lopped off and left upon the
ground, which was entirely covered with the stumps, logs and brush; and
through this almost impenetrable Chevaux de Frise, the men attempted
to charge, and over which a perfect storm of shell, canister and
rifle bullets flew like hail; no formation could be maintained over
such grounds and in a few moments it was every one for himself. The
“Forlorn Hope” and the main line became inextricably mixed, and
advanced together, charged nearly up to the rebel works, but the fire
was so severe that human endurance was not equal to the task set for
us, and the men were compelled to drop behind stumps and logs, and
take advantage of any shelter to be found, and acted as sharpshooters,
hoping that reinforcements might be sent up and continue the assault.
The 2d Louisiana from Dudley’s brigade came up the road later, but too
late to be of any service, and the assault was abandoned, and the men
dropped back individually to their old line as best they could. Col.
Chapin, 116th New York, commanding the brigade, Lieut.-Col. O’Brien,
48th Massachusetts, commanding the “Forlorn Hope,” and many others were
killed; Capt. Rogers, Co. H, Capt. Smith, Co. I, Lieuts. Morrison,
Frawley, Maginnis, Ricker, Bassett and Harding, and many others
wounded, and a large number of the rank and file of the regiment were
killed or more or less seriously wounded; Lieut. Ricker suffered the
amputation of his leg. As we came back from the front, we had our first
sight of the dreadful effects of a battle and burial of the dead in one
line, about twenty dead bodies lying at the side of the road, and the
long trench all ready to receive them. Poor fellows, with no coffin and
no shroud but the blue uniform in which they had shed their blood for
the flag they loved.

May 28. Ambulances and stretchers under flags of truce have been
going all night, bringing in the bodies of the dead and wounded. Col.
Chapin’s body has been sent to New Orleans. Lieut.-Col. O’Brien’s body
has just been found in the most advanced line. When his clothes were
opened the bullet which penetrated his body fell out, it having passed
entirely through him and flattened up against a steel vest which he
wore into the battle. He recklessly exposed himself and lost his life
by so doing, seeking to retrieve himself from Gen. Augur’s kindly
criticism of his mistake of the 21st at Plains Store.

May 29. The regiment laid on their arms all night in expectation of
an attack by the garrison, but the night passed away and all has been
quiet in camp today. Several heavy thunder showers in the afternoon.
Orders received to fall in with all our traps and go to the rear; mud
very deep and the march tedious.

The 2d Louisiana has been attached to our brigade and Col. Charles J.
Paine of that regiment, being senior Colonel, takes command of the
brigade. He is a Massachusetts man and is said to be a fine officer.

May 30. Cannonading going on all the night and day from the batteries
and from the fleet. Marched back to our old camp in front.

June 1. A Lieutenant of sharpshooters wounded during the early morning.
Gen. Banks was much chagrined at the failure of the first assault.
Regiment marched back to the rear after dark to support batteries. Laid
in cornfield with cornstalks for bedding and pillow.

June 2. Regiment got into line at 4 o’clock and marched back to old
camp ground. Co. E detailed to go to the rear to guard the baggage
train to relieve Co. G.

June 3. Smart cannonading all night. Gen. Banks and Admiral Farragut
give the rebs no peace day or night.

June 4. Regiment marched back to the old camp in front. Four men of Co.
B reported from Baton Rouge.

June 5. Officers ordered to report at Brigade Headquarters to confer
about Lieutenant-Colonelcy. The laws of Massachusetts state explicitly
that the vacancy shall be filled by the votes of the line officers of
the regiment.

June 6. Rumored preparations for another assault. Col. Stone sent for
Capt. Stanwood and requested him to act as Lieutenant-Colonel till the
vacancy could be legally filled, saying that an election would soon be
ordered.

June 7. False alarm in the night. Man with nightmare disturbed camp
by upsetting a stack of guns and bringing out the whole regiment.
Inspection at 9 o’clock A. M.

June 8. Harrison W. Dearborn, Co. B, died at Baton Rouge. Immense lots
of cotton bales being hauled to the front for breastworks.

June 9. Smart firing during the night. Large fire to be seen in Port
Hudson.

June 10. Some heavy cannonading during the night. Chaplain came up from
Baton Rouge with mail today. Quartermaster came up from Baton Rouge
with new teams.

June 11. Many of the men are suffering badly from rheumatism, malaria
and kindred ailments, acquired from lying in the rifle pits, which
are much of the time half full of water. Nothing more has been said
regarding an election of Lieutenant-Colonel, and there is much
speculation among the officers and men as to the reason.

June 12. An election for Lieutenant-Colonel was ordered by Col. Stone
and held today and Capt. Stanwood was unanimously chosen.

June 13. The regiment received orders at 10 o’clock A. M. to report to
Gen. Augur’s headquarters at once. On reporting to Gen. Augur we were
ordered to march away to the right to report to Gen. Arnold, chief of
artillery. Reported at about 11 o’clock after a very quick march, in
which many of the men suffered terribly, it being in the very heat
of the day and with but one halt on the road; we must have marched
at least seven or eight miles. Stacked arms and took entrenching
tools--which in plain English means picks and shovels and axes. Some
of the companies were detailed to clear out a big ravine which led
up in the direction of the rebel breastworks and just in the rear of
where it was intended to plant a battery, while others were busied in
throwing up the breastworks, carrying up ammunition and other duties.
Worked till dark and without supper; made preparations to bivouac, when
we were ordered to take up our march again to our old camp at the rear
near the Plains Store, whence we had started in the morning. Arrived in
camp late in the evening, and after enjoying (?) coffee and hardtack
laid our tired bones on the ground with the hope of gaining some rest;
but our hopes were blasted. We had got scarcely settled to rest when
the following order was received directly from Gen. Banks’ headquarters:

  “Headquarters, Department of the Gulf.
  “Before Port Hudson, June 13, 1863, 8.45 P. M.

 “Maj.-Gen. Augur will order the 48th Massachusetts, Col. Stone, to
 proceed at once to the headquarters of the 2d Division and report for
 temporary duty to Brig.-Gen. William Dwight, commanding the Division.
 A general assault upon the works of the enemy at Port Hudson will be
 made tomorrow morning, 14th instant.”

The regiment got into line, being nearly 500 strong (or weak), but so
used up that many fell out during the march through the woods, which
occupied nearly all the night--the guide sent with us losing the
way--and it was nearly morning when Col. Stone reported to Gen. Dwight.
It was intended that we should occupy the extreme left on the river
bank and make our charge at that point; but after reconnoitering the
ground we were moved further to the right, to near the Mount Pleasant
road, and bivouacked at the side of the road.

June 14. A dense fog prevailing and terribly hot. Col. Stone reported
to Gen. Dwight at a very early hour, before light, with 175 men and
four Captains present for duty, the rest of the men having become
exhausted by the work of yesterday and the night march through the
woods, having started from Plains Store yesterday morning with nearly
500 men.

A tremendous artillery fire for an hour commenced at about 3 o’clock,
both from land forces and the fleet. The men present in the regiment
were consolidated into four companies, and Capt. Todd volunteered to
take command of the right company, consisting of remnants of Cos. B and
E.

The bombardment continued fiercely for an hour, during which time the
columns were being formed for the assault in the rear of a piece of
woods; the formation was in column by companies and Capt. Todd led the
advance. We in the 48th could see the effect of the rebel fire on the
brigade in advance of us, as it turned the corner of the woods into
the Mount Pleasant road. Quickly the order came down to “Forward the
Brigade” (we were attached for the day to the brigade commanded by Col.
Benedict). When we came out from the shelter of the woods the fire of
the enemy was terrible, but the column moved forward firmly; the rebel
line of breastworks was clearly defined before us, with the “Citadel”
frowning in the front. As we advanced the march from quick time soon
became double quick, and finally a mad rush, passing over dead and
wounded in the road. The air fairly hissed with bullets and shell, the
groans of the wounded mingled with the cheers and yells of the charging
troops, the shouts of the officers and also their imprecations as some
poor fellows, losing their presence of mind, would try to dodge the
flying missiles as they passed to bury themselves with a sickening
“thud” in some other doomed comrade’s body; it seemed as if pandemonium
was let loose, and when we overtook and passed over the prostrate
bodies of the red clothed fascine bearers, who had started in advance
of the main column and who, unable to face the leaden storm, had
dropped their burdens and taken shelter behind them, they were greeted
with cries of derision, which quickly changed to cries of dismay when
we came into the vortex and saw the ground swept as it were by a
whirlwind, and every man sought shelter in ravines, behind stumps, logs
and any object which could afford shelter.

This ended Gen. Dwight’s movement. But it had advanced our lines so
that we held possession of a rough hill which commanded the “Citadel,”
which had been the objective point of our assault, and which was the
most formidable point in the rebel works. The men held themselves
well and showed that former experiences had had a good effect. Capt.
Todd was seriously wounded in the mouth; Adjt. Ogden was slightly
wounded; Darius Nelson of Co. B was killed and others both killed and
wounded. The Lieutenant-Colonel was thrown down by the explosion of a
shell, which happily did not wound him, but his right leg was serious
paralyzed and he laid on the field all day exposed to the pitiless
fire of the rebel sharpshooters and the scarcely less endurable rays
of the burning Louisiana sun, until night came and the Ambulance Corps
and brought relief. The scenes on the field were heart-rending, and
the sufferings of the wounded appealed so strongly to the sympathy of
their more fortunate comrades that lives were lost and others risked
attempting to succor these unfortunate men.

The movement was much criticized by some of the officers, especially
the cannonade which preceded the assault, as it is said that by it
the rebs were apprised that an assault was to be made and they were
prepared to repel it, and the day which had opened so auspiciously
ended in gloom. Details of stretcher-bearers plying their melancholy
duty carried the wounded to the hospitals, and the dead swiftly to the
long trenches.

June 15. Regiment was relieved from support of battery and marched
leisurely back to our old camp near the front center. The men were
almost entirely exhausted, but it was impossible to excuse them from
duty, as all are in the same condition.

June 16. Received orders during the day calling for volunteers for
another storming party of 1000 men.

June 17. Passed the night in the rifle pits. There was a very heavy
rain early in the morning, filling the pits and making the situation
very disagreeable. Order in regard to detail of one officer and
twenty-five men for storming party countermanded, as more than the
required number had volunteered.

June 18. Regiment supporting an Indiana battery, at the front, early in
the morning having moved in to the rifle pits.

June 20. Sharpshooters are making things lively. There are rumors
floating through the camps that Vicksburg has fallen. Regiment ordered
to move into the rifle pits at dark.

June 21. Regiment occupied the rifle pits last night. The 2d Vermont
Battery kept up a kind of intermittent firing. Regiment relieved at
night and returned to the rear, bivouacking in the woods.

June 22. Election held in Co. B for vacant offices. Lieut. Merrill
was elected Captain, receiving 16 votes to 15 for Lieut. Rollins; 1st
Sergt. James S. Walsh was elected Second Lieutenant.

June 23. There has been considerable discussion of the vexing question
of termination of service. There are very few officers left with the
regiment, and the duty is very hard in consequence.

June 24. Lieut. Maginnis (who was wounded in the assault of the 27th of
May) died of his wounds today.

June 26. Orders received to take the regiment to the rear and bivouac
near Brigade Headquarters, and just at night ordered to relieve the 2d
Louisiana in the advance rifle pits.

June 27. Col. Stone on the sick list. After being relieved from
the rifle pits ordered to go to the left and support the 49th
Massachusetts and 21st Maine, which we did, bivouacking at 11 o’clock
P. M.

June 29. Heavy cannonading all night. An attempt was made a little to
our left and front to capture an outpost of ours, but it failed; the
rebs were repulsed, and it is said with a loss of 90 prisoners; cannot
vouch for the truth of the rumor. Regiment ordered into the rifle pits
to support Holcomb’s 2d Vermont Battery.

June 30. Were in the rifle pits near Holcomb’s Battery all night.
There were sounds of a smart skirmish down on the extreme left, which
continued about an hour. Col. Stone left today for Baton Rouge, sick.

July 1. Regiment bivouacking near Brigade Headquarters. Rebs made a
raid into Springfield Landing, stampeding the guards and destroying a
considerable amount of government stores.

July 2. Regiment has laid in the woods near Brigade Headquarters this
forenoon. Near noon orders came to fall in to repel an attack from
the rebs in the rear who had raided Springfield Landing and after
destroying the government stores there were now on the march for
Port Hudson. The “march to Port Hudson” proved to be a hoax, and the
regiment was soon dismissed and at night went into the front rifle pits.

July 3. Regiment occupied the rifle pits, supporting Holcomb’s Battery.
Rebel sharpshooters very active. Gen. Grover visited the battery this
afternoon. He looks anxious and careworn. Relieved from rifle pits by
the 116th New York.

July 4. National salute fired at sunrise with shotted guns. This is not
our usual way of celebrating our National birthday. Regiment received
orders to get into line prepared to make another assault. The “Forlorn
Hope” was already in position at the front. The regiment stood in
line many long and weary hours, anxiously awaiting the signal gun to
commence the assault. For some reason the assault was not made, and
after a tedious wait we were relieved and allowed to return to camp.
Another salute with shotted guns was fired at noon by Nims’ Battery. A
member of Co. E, who was captured from us on May 21st at Plains Store,
escaped from Port Hudson today and came back to camp.

July 5. Gen. Banks has just passed up to the front with a flag of
truce. Ordered into the rifle pits at night.

July 6. Passed the night in the rifle pits. The regiment is being
rapidly decimated by hard duty and exposure to this terrible hot
weather.

July 7. Two rebels came into headquarters from Port Hudson, and their
accounts show that the garrison can hold out but a very short time.

Official news has been received from Gen. Grant that Vicksburg
surrendered on the 4th. A gunboat came down river from that place
early this morning bringing the news. Communication with the army was
for some reason broken and it was quite late in the day before the
message was delivered to Gen. Banks. It was at once communicated to the
troops in the trenches; from man to man, from company to company, from
regiment to regiment the word passed, and the cheers from the men rang
out and the long silenced bands filled the forests with the strains
of the “Star Spangled Banner,” “America,” “Yankee Doodle” and other
patriotic music. Received orders for the 48th to occupy the rifle pits
and support Holcomb’s 2d Vermont Battery tonight.

Before going on duty the Lieutenant-Colonel visited Gen. Augur’s
headquarters, by his request, and was particularly instructed and
cautioned as to his duty. He said, “You are going into the most
important position on the line, and as the ranking officer on the
brigade picket line you will be expected to exercise the greatest
vigilance. The information we have leads us to expect that the enemy
will offer to surrender or make an attempt to break out through our
thin lines, and it is expected that you will be prepared for either or
any emergency. Double your outer picket line, keep your men well in
hand and allow none to sleep. If any attempt is made to break out it
must be prevented at all hazards till reinforcements reach you, which
you may feel assured will be pushed forward to your assistance at the
first alarm, and you must check the attack at the hazard of your lives;
two companies from another regiment will be ordered into the rifle pits
to strengthen your line.” Regiment went into the rifle pits at about 9
o’clock in the evening.

July 8. The inevitable has happened! Port Hudson has fallen! Regiment
laid quietly in rifle pits till shortly after 12 o’clock, midnight,
the notes of a bugle were heard in our front sounding “a parley,” and
a few seconds later an officer with a small escort approached, bearing
a lantern fixed to a long pole, with a white handkerchief tied beneath
it to serve as a flag of truce. At the outpost the flag was halted and
its object ascertained, which was the delivery of a dispatch to Gen.
Banks from Gen. Gardner, in command of the Confederate forces in Port
Hudson, which was immediately dispatched to Gen. Banks’ headquarters
by messenger. The dispatch contained a request for official assurance
as to the truth of the report that Vicksburg had surrendered. If
true, Gardner asked for a cessation of hostilities, with a view to
consider terms of surrender of Port Hudson, and soon a blast upon a
bugle brought back the little party of Confederates with the lantern
swinging from the pole and the conference culminated in an agreement to
surrender, and that a commission be appointed from each side to agree
upon terms.

[Illustration: LANDING AT BATON ROUGE, LA.,

Looking Up River.]

Orders were immediately issued to cease firing all along the line and
also from the fleet. Brig.-Gen. C. P. Stone, Col. Birge and Brig.-Gen.
Dwight were designated by Gen. Banks as such commission. At 9 o’clock
this morning the commissioners from both armies met just in front of
our position, and nearly on the spot where Lieut.-Col. O’Brien had
formed his men while waiting for the word on that eventful 27th of
May. On the Confederate side the commissioners were Col. Miles, Col.
Steedman, 1st Alabama, and Lieut.-Col. Smith, Chief of Artillery.
Gen. Andrew was designated to receive the surrender, which it was
finally decided should take place tomorrow morning, the 9th. The men
of the 48th can feel with considerable satisfaction that through the
carrying out of Col. Paine’s plan (to crowd the hard work of the siege
onto the nine months regiments) they have been placed in a position
where they can claim the honor of receiving the flag of truce which
surrendered this great stronghold after so many weary and exciting
weeks of fighting, digging and suffering. While the negotiations have
been going on officers from some of the rebel regiments came over into
our lines and fraternized with us as socially as though no state of war
ever existed between the two sections of the country, and one officer
expressed the wish that the war could now close and the North and South
combine and whip out England; his reason being “that England had not
recognized the independence of the Confederacy after the Trent affair.”

July 9. The 48th was in line promptly at 4.30 this morning, in
accordance with orders, but was obliged to wait until nearly 10
o’clock before commencing to march into Port Hudson, en route for
Donaldsonville, at which hour the 48th with the Massachusetts 49th
and 21st Maine took up the line of march to the landing and embarked
on board steamer “Louisiana Belle” late in the afternoon after the
ceremony of surrender, which was very short. The rebels were drawn
up in line with Gen. Gardner at their head, the right resting near
the railroad station. When the command “ground arms” was given every
man placed his musket upon the ground. It was a very affecting sight,
and there was no man in the victorious army who did not experience
a feeling of pity go out to the brave men who had been compelled to
surrender after so long and so brilliant defense. Gen. Gardner tendered
his sword to Gen. Andrews who declined to receive it. The rebel flag
was hauled down from the flagstaff where it so defiantly floated
through the siege. A salute was fired by the naval battery, the stars
and stripes run up. The garrison filed off as prisoners of war, and all
was over.

More than 6,000 rebels surrendered. The soldiers were paroled but
the officers were held as prisoners of war. Twenty pieces of heavy
artillery and more than 30 pieces of field artillery were captured.
The loss of the 19th army corps during the siege has been nearly
5,000 men. No correct account has been made of the rebel loss, but
an approximate calculation will give it as nearly 1,000, which,
considering that their fighting has been entirely behind breastworks,
is very heavy. Port Hudson is a very strong place and would have cost
us many more men to have taken it by storm. As we steamed away from
the landing and gazed at the bluffs and remembered the long weeks of
waiting in front of its land batteries we could but take a long drawn
sigh of relief. We shall no doubt soon be sent home. Home! Can any
outside the army imagine what this word means to us who have lain so
many weary weeks in the swamps of Louisiana, watching the lines of the
enemy with the eyes of hungry wolves, dying by hundreds, by bullet, and
shell, and disease. It means friends, comfort, life itself, in exchange
for misery, squalor, dirt, a dog’s life, and death, and an unknown
grave.

July 10. Reached Donaldsonville at 9 o’clock A. M. While on the passage
down, and we were at breakfast, the steamer was fired on from the
shore, but happily no one was hit. The shots were returned from the
boat, but with what results of course we could not know, but we were
not further molested.

After landing we made a reconnaissance till nearly dark when the
regiment bivouacked for the night near the levee. The rebels have
evidently drawn away their forces from the river and we shall probably
have to seek them further inland.

July 11. False alarm in the night. Regiment fell in with arms, but were
soon dismissed.

July 12. A steamer came up from New Orleans which shows that the
blockade is raised, and the Mississippi river throughout its whole
length is clear for the first time in two whole years.

July 13. Col. Paine’s brigade received orders while at breakfast to
fall in and march to support Col. Dudley. Marched out several miles
and halted to make preparations for dinner, there being no indications
of being called into action very soon. Some were fortunate enough to
dine early, their meal being very frugal, and hard tack and coffee
constituted their principal fare, and a little green corn from the
fields. We were startled by the rattle of musketry in our immediate
front, and we were at once ordered into line and found that Dudley
was engaged with the enemy and had been gradually driving them back
until he came upon their main line, when he was in turn being slowly
and obstinately forced back. Our brigade was now ordered to the front
at “double quick” on the road parallel to the bayou, and soon ordered
to file to the right into a little green plantation road or path, and
halted, our left resting on the bayou road. In our front was a rail
fence with a deep ditch at the side of the road; beyond the fence an
open field of about 125 yards extent and beyond that an immense corn
field. By the waving of the corn tops we could trace the movements of
Dudley’s men and could see that they were slowly retreating and coming
back gradually towards our line. The regiment was ordered to occupy
the ditch at the side of the road. Very soon Dudley’s men made their
appearance out of the corn, loading and firing as they fell slowly
back. A more soldierly appearance could not have been made than was
made by the regiment in our immediate front (the 161st New York. Col.
Harrower,) as they retired, slowly, towards our line, turning and firing
as they retreated. They came over the fence in our front and passed over
us to our rear, where they laid down. The rebels followed them closely
to the edge of the cornfield, and attempted to cross the open field
in our front, but were immediately sent to the “right about” in some
confusion, by the fire from the trusty rifles in the hands of the 48th
boys who laid close to the ground, firing under the bottom rail in the
fence, and the range being low the shots were very effective.

A short time previous, Col. Paine had taken the 49th out of their place
in line, which was on our immediate right, leaving a gap in the brigade
line which the 48th was directed to cover with an oblique fire, thus
giving us double ground to cover. Col. Paine before leaving with the
49th came to Lieut.-Col. Stanwood and directed him to hold our ground
at all hazards till his return.

The rebels tried several times to charge across the open field in our
front, but were as often driven back by the steady fire from our men in
the ditch.

While this was transpiring, the rebels had driven back the brigade on
the opposite side of the bayou until their fire enfiladed the left
of our brigade, and at the same time were rapidly flanking the whole
force on our right which began to fall back, and in a short time we
were left alone upon the field. A staff officer from Col. Dudley rode
up and ordered the Lieutenant-Colonel to retire the regiment. His
authority was not recognized, Lieut.-Col. Stanwood having received
orders from our own brigade commander (Col. Paine) to hold the ground
at all hazards until his return, which order he held himself bound to
obey. Soon on looking to the right and left not a blue-coated soldier
could be seen, and away to the right the rebel could be seen passing
rapidly to the rear. On the opposite side of the bayou the fighting was
going on far to our rear while from our front in the corn desultory
shots came, viciously striking the fence rails above our heads. Feeling
that in this case “discretion was the better part of valor” and not
caring to be a second Casabianca, he directed the men to pass the word
quietly down the line, without rising, and retire from their position
as best they could, and rally in the rear on the colors.

This they did, and the rebs were so close that many of the men were
captured before they had time to retire from the ditch! The 48th lost
in killed, wounded and missing 65 out of a total 201 men engaged.
Lieut. Wilson, Co. D, and Lieut. Bassett, Co. I, were taken prisoners.
Lieut. Wilson was reported as also wounded.

The men after retiring from the ditch rallied in the rear, and later
took their place in the line of the brigade in the rear and in a low
swamp. A tremendous rain storm came up towards night flooding our camp.

July 14. Our camp is located in a low swamp and is completely
inundated. The men are all thoroughly soaked to the skin. The day has
been spent in bringing in the dead and wounded. Among the dead is
Edward T. Bennett of Co. B.

July 15. Still in camp at Donaldsonville. Received dispatches from
New Orleans, announcing a great victory in Pennsylvania by Gen.
Meade’s army, on the 1st, 2d and 3d days of July. The first week
in July has been a week of tremendous importance to the Union
cause--Vicksburg-Port Hudson, and now this great victory of Gen. Meade’s
at Gettysburg--three names long to be remembered in American history.
We hear that Col. Stone has recovered his horse which was captured from
him at the battle of Plains Store, May 21.

July 16. Regiment received orders to change camp to the rear to secure
higher ground, by which move the 48th has secured the best location
in the brigade line. There are all sorts of rumors in regard to going
home. Suppose that some of them may be true and expect that now that
Port Hudson has been taken that we shall be sent home before long.
Received word from Baton Rouge that Joseph B. Hale of Co. B died in the
hospital there today.

July 17. All prisoners taken from us on the 13th have been paroled, and
have returned to camp today having marched from Thibodaux. They say
that the rebs had less than a thousand men on our side of the bayou in
the battle, and our defeat was all owing to bad generalship on the part
of our commanding officers.

July 18. Daniel F. Connell of Co. B who was taken prisoner on the 13th,
came back to camp today, having been paroled, and walked from the rebel
camp (which he thinks is nearly 100 miles from here) with one hardtack
and a little corn meal for his rations during the march.

He thinks there are from 10,000 to 20,000 rebels between Donaldsonville
and Thibodaux, with considerable artillery. A continued discussion of
the question of “going home” now principally occupies the time of the
men.

July 21. Capt. Bainbridge, a U. S. army officer, came to camp today and
the Lieutenant-Colonel at once went before him and was mustered out as
captain and immediately mustered in as Lieutenant-Colonel.

July 22. Capt. Schoff, Lieut. Morrison with a detail of thirty-three
men went foraging at 4.30 this morning and returned at 3 P. M. having
gone out about nine miles and obtained a large amount of corn. The
regiment is now nearly destitute of commissioned officers.

July 23. The glorious news from Gen. Meade’s army confirmed. Gen. Lee
entirely defeated at Gettysburg, Penn., and driven back into Virginia.
Our friends at home have by this time heard of our victory at Port
Hudson and will be now looking for our return. Heavy thunder showers
today.

July 24. Paymaster Maj. Palmer arrived at 7.30 o’clock A. M. and
proceeded to pay off the regiment, which feat was accomplished at noon.
Maj. Palmer informs us that the campaign is over and the men are being
sent home as fast as transportation can be furnished.

July 25. Alarm in the night caused by the pickets firing into some old
horse or mule.

July 26. Col. Love, 116th New York, in command of the brigade during
Col. Paine’s absence.

July 27. Very quiet in camp last night.

July 29. Regiment received drums today, and resumed regular dress
parades which have been greatly interfered with during the siege of
Port Hudson and during the stay here in Donaldsonville.

July 30. The camp here at Donaldsonville is evidently breaking up; some
of the troops are on the move at daylight. Gen. Weitzel’s old brigade
has marched for Thibodaux. We are still kept on the “ragged edge” all
the time looking for orders to start for Baton Rouge and home.

July 31. Orders have been received at headquarters for our removal
to Baton Rouge, as soon as transportation can be furnished. At
11.30 o’clock this forenoon orders were received to prepare to move
immediately. Several steamers have come and gone but none for us as
yet, which is very tantalizing.

August 1. Steamer “Kepper” arrived and the 48th immediately went on
board as also the 49th. Quarters were very much crowded and the men
have suffered intensely on the hot deck during the passage up the river
to Baton Rouge where we arrived just before dark. Disembarked with
military precision.

August 2. Glad to get to our old quarters which seems something like
home. During the night some of the men were jubilantly celebrating
their return and became over-boisterous. The chaplain’s tent caught
fire from some mysterious cause and burned down. Col. Stone, although
having left the regiment when in front of Port Hudson, and remained
in Baton Rouge since that time on the sick list, took command of the
regiment at once.

August 3. Col. Stone decided that he is able to take command of
the regiment. How little we anticipated when we left Baton Rouge
in May what changes would take place before we should return in
August--Lieut.-Col. O’Brien and so many other brave and good men gone.

August 4. The Colonel has reported for duty. Orders have been received
for an inspection of the regiment which at this time looks much like
going home.

August 5. Our old parade ground which we used when we first came
to Baton Rouge does not look at all familiar. The 49th Regiment has
received orders to take transportation for New Orleans at once.

August 6. We are expecting every moment to get orders to start for
home, and the delay is very vexatious.

August 7. Received orders to start for home by way of the Mississippi
river and Cairo, Ill. (and in consequence we are all feeling happy), as
soon as transportation can be secured.

August 8. The men are all busily engaged cleaning up guns and
equipments to turn over before going home. Home! how pleasant the
sound, when it means so much to us who have for so long a time been
deprived of all the comforts of home.

August 9. Inspection came off this morning at 7 o’clock and everything
was found in “spick and span” condition. Notice has been received
that the steamer is awaiting us at the landing, and we have turned in
all ordnance and ordnance stores, surplus clothing, camp and garrison
equipage and are now on board steamer “Sunny South” ready for the
start.

August 10. Steamer started up river at 3 o’clock this morning and
arrived opposite Port Hudson at sunrise. Our passing of the batteries
was much more quietly accomplished than was Commodore Farragut’s last
March. The scenery on the Mississippi River is very monotonous and
tame. Have passed only one little village today. Fort Adams passed at 3
o’clock P. M. The men are suffering terribly from heat on the “burning
deck.” At 10 P. M. arrived at Natchez. Since coming to Louisiana we
have been using New Orleans horse car tickets and postage stamps for
change.

August 11. We left Natchez at 5 P. M. The bluffs here at Natchez are
150 feet in height. The city is very prettily situated. Passed village of
Washington on the left at 10.30 A. M.; Passed Gen. Taylor’s plantation
at 11.30 A. M.; Grand Gulf at 3 P. M.--a very strong place. Passed
wreck of Indianola at sunset. Arrived at Vicksburg soon after 11
o’clock at night.

August 12. Passed head of the celebrated Vicksburg canal at 11.15 A. M.
Passed Millican’s Bend at 2 o’clock P. M. Steamer “Tempest” with the
49th Massachusetts on board has passed up.

August 13. Passed Napoleon Ark at the mouth of the Arkansas River about
9 o’clock.

August 14. Arrived at Helena, Ark., at 1.30 P. M. Stopped to coal till
4 o’clock and went on shore to stretch our legs during the stay. It is
a very strong natural fortification, and many artificial works have
been erected in addition. Two men were drowned attempting to come on
board.

August 15. Arrived at Memphis at about 6 o’clock A. M. Left at 11.30 P. M.

August 16. Steamer ran aground and stuck fast for hours; reached Gayoso
Landing at 4 P. M.

One must travel on the Mississippi River to get any idea of its
greatness. Here we go puffing along, day after day, and night after
night, and we wake up every morning and the same grand old river
stretches away before us.

The distances on the Mississippi River are as follows: Passes to New
Orleans, 125 miles; New Orleans to Baton Rouge, 130; Baton Rouge to
Port Hudson, 30; Port Hudson to Natchez, 100; Natchez to Vicksburg,
140; Vicksburg to Memphis, 360; Memphis to Cairo, 240; total 1125
miles.

August 17. Arrived opposite Columbus, Kentucky, at 8 A. M. when the
steamer was brought to by a shot across her bows from the Battery at
this point. Arrived at Cairo, Ill., at 10 A. M. While stopping here
there has been some trouble with some of the more turbulent men on
account of their not being allowed to go on shore.

August 18. At 10 o’clock A. M. commenced changing baggage from the
steamer to the cars which occupied the time till about dark when
the regiment went on board the cars and run out about 20 miles to a
station called Wetaug, arriving a little before midnight and stopped
till daylight. The delay is very tedious and vexatious. We are going
home and trains going to the front have the right of way and so we are
side-tracked to await their passing.

August 20. Still dragging slowly along. Arrived at Indianapolis, Ind.,
at 11 o’clock A. M. Regiment marched to the Soldiers’ Home where a
bountiful collation was furnished by the people of the city. James H.
Short of Co. B, who was very sick when we left Baton Rouge, was left
here in the hospital, he not being able to travel further.

August 21. Arrived at Gallion, Ohio, at 6 o’clock A. M. Could get
nothing to eat on arrival, being at so early an hour. Reached Crestline
at 6.30 A. M.; Cleveland at noon. Here we met with a very kind
reception from the citizens with a good dinner; also the same repeated
at Erie, Penn. Reached Buffalo at 9.30 P. M. and received another
splendid reception with collation. Here we changed cars and started for
Albany at about midnight.

August 22. Arrived at Utica at 10.30 A. M. and were tendered another
fine collation spread at the side of the track. Continued on for Albany
where we arrived about 4 o’clock P. M.; went at once to the ferry and
cars en route for Boston at sunset. Made good time and arrived at
Springfield, Mass., at midnight. Here a few minutes were allowed to
obtain lunch for which we had to pay a good round price--the first
which has cost us a cent since leaving Cairo, and some considerable
comment has been made that Massachusetts should be the first to ask her
returning soldiers to pay for their rations.

August 23. Arrived in Boston without further incidents at 7.30 A. M.
Marched to the Beach Street Barracks where we were served a government
ration (which did not compare favorably with the food served out to us
by the citizens of the cities and towns through which we have passed
on our way home) after which the men were furloughed till September 3,
then to report at our old Camp Lander at Wenham to be mustered out.

September 3. Regiment reported at Camp Lander, Wenham, and were
mustered out. Casualties during the campaign: Killed and died of
wounds, 23; wounded, 73; died of disease, 40; total, 136.

Maj.-Gen. Christopher C. Augur was in command of the 1st Division, 19th
Army Corps, to which the 48th Massachusetts was attached and served its
whole term of service.

He was born in New York, but was appointed to West Point from Michigan;
graduated 16th in the class of 1843 (in which class Gen. Grant was the
21st). He served in the Mexican war with credit, and at the breaking
out of the Rebellion was given a commission of Brigadier-General of
Volunteers Nov. 12, 1861; was in command of a Division under Gen. Banks
in the Shenandoah Valley, and was wounded severely at Cedar Mountain,
receiving therefor a brevet of Colonel in the Regular Army; was
promoted to Major-General of Volunteers, Aug. 9, 1862, and assigned to
the command of the left wing of the army before Port Hudson, retired as
full Brigadier-General in the Regular Army in 1885.

Colonel Edward P. Chapin, who commanded the 1st Brigade in Gen. Augurs
Division, of which the 48th Massachusetts constituted a part, was
the Colonel of the 116th New York. He was a very able and efficient
officer, and it was expected that he would rise to advanced rank, but
was killed in the desperate assault on Port Hudson, May 27, 1863, and
thus the army and the country lost the services of a very promising
officer. He was succeeded in the command of the Brigade by Col. Charles
J. Paine of the 2d Louisiana Infantry, who remained in command during
the remainder of the 48th’s term, and subsequently received the brevets
of Brigadier and Major-General of Volunteers.

The regiment, as finally made up, represented all classes. It contained
recruits from the best old New England families in Essex and Middlesex,
and from emigrants recently from foreign countries. A good example of
the former was the late Samuel Hoar of Concord (son of the late Judge
E. Rockwood Hoar and nephew of the late Senator George F. Hoar), who
left college to enlist as a private soldier in Company E, and who
served the full term, then re-entered and graduated at Harvard College.
He subsequently became a very able lawyer and distinguished citizen. He
died April 11th, 1904, aged 59 years.

Col. Eben F. Stone was a man of high character and standing in the
community in which he lived, and that had much to do with his selection
to command the regiment. As time went on he failed somewhat as a
tactician, and the regiment was at a disadvantage on this account,
although he could have passed an excellent examination in tactics. He
was a brave officer and well liked by the officers and soldiers of his
regiment. Colonel Stone, after the war, made an honorable record in
the civil service of the government. He served two years in the State
Senate and two terms in Congress.

Lieut.-Col. O’Brien was regarded as a good officer and brave to the
degree of recklessness.

Capt. Stanwood earned the promotion which he received by a unanimous
election as Lieutenant-Colonel by able, faithful, and patriotic
services.

Dr. Yorick G. Hurd was one of the best surgeons of the Civil War. The
death rate from sickness in our regiment was less than in any other
in the Department, and that was due in great part to the faithful,
conscientious, and untiring services of Dr. Hurd. He had not a lazy
bone in his body. After the war he rendered good services in the
military and civil service of the State. He was medical director of the
Division on the Staff of General B. F. Butler, with rank of Colonel,
from 1867 to 1876. He served two years in the State Senate. He did for
many years excellent service as Master of the House of Correction and
Superintendent of the Insane Asylum at Ipswich.

Capt. Edgar J. Sherman (of the same family of Roger Sherman and General
William T. Sherman), enlisted as a private soldier and was subsequently
elected Captain of Company F.

When the regiment advanced on Port Hudson he was in the hospital sick
of malarial fever. Hearing of the affair of Plains Store, the Captain,
somewhat relieved of the fever but weak and emaciated, decided to
join the regiment. The surgeons tried to induce him to remain a while
longer, but not succeeding in this, gave orders forbidding it. The next
morning the Captain put on his uniform, left the hospital, and took the
early steamer for Springfield Landing. There he was met by the surgeons
who called him a “walking ghost,” and ordered him back to Baton Rouge.
The Captain said he was not going on duty but only to visit the surgeon
of his regiment and he was allowed to proceed.

He was there several days, remaining with Dr. Hurd, when he learned
that there was to be a charge on the enemy’s works the next day. He at
once determined to go on duty. The Colonel and surgeon advised against
it, withholding their consent, the doctor saying, “Captain, if you go
into this fight and are not killed, your fever will come back and you
will leave your bones in Louisiana.” Capt. Sherman made the long march
that night, with the aid of his soldiers, and led his two companies
which carried the colors in the charge next day. When the charge did
not succeed and the order came to get off the field, the Captain
finally reached the ravine on the left, and was subsequently carried on
a stretcher to the rear. Dr. Hurd found him exhausted, with the fever
returning, and ordered him sent at once to the hospital at Baton Rouge.

[Illustration: THE IRONCLAD ESSEX.]

[Illustration: WHARF BOAT NATCHEZ,

At Baton Rouge, La., 1863.]

Just as the Captain was being put into the ambulance he said to Dr.
Hurd, “It is too bad about poor Captain Todd; he went down right in
front of me and we went right on over his dead body.” “Not by a
d---- sight!” said the Doctor. “I took an old broken French bayonet
three inches long out of his mouth and he is all right.”

Captain Sherman was seriously and dangerously ill for some time, and
it was feared that the Doctor’s prophecy might become true,--that
the Captain would “leave his bones in Louisiana,” but he recovered
sufficiently to return home with the regiment.

Officers and men were so much needed at the time that Captain Sherman’s
disobedience of the order “not to leave the hospital” was condoned,
and upon the recommendation of his superior officers, he was brevetted
Major “for gallant and meritorious services.”

Major Sherman subsequently served in the military and civil services of
the State. In 1864, at the time of General Early’s raid on Washington,
he raised a company for one hundred days and was elected its Captain,
and the company became Company K of the 6th Regiment.

He served as Assistant Adjutant General, with the rank of Colonel, and
as Chief of Staff of the Division, General B. F. Butler’s, from 1867 to
1876. He served fourteen years as District Attorney for Essex County,
five years as Attorney General, and now a Justice of the Superior
Court, where he has served since 1887.

Capt. J. Scott Todd was an excellent officer, always faithful to every
duty.

He was wounded and disabled in the charge on June 14. The enemy were
short of ammunition and they used broken iron. An old piece of a
French bayonet three inches long struck him in the mouth, knocking out
his upper and under front teeth, cutting his tongue in two, its full
length, and finally embedded itself in the roof of his mouth. The blow
was so severe that the Captain lay on the field stunned and unconscious
for a long time. With assistance he finally reached the rear and the
doctor removed the iron and he was soon in condition for duty.

After the war the Captain did honorable service in the civil government
of the State. He served two years in the State Senate. He also served
for many years as a Trial Justice.

The following is taken from Hanson’s History of the Sixth Regiment:

“Company K, Capt. Edgar J. Sherman, Lawrence.

“This company was a new one, raised mostly in Lawrence upon the call
of the Governor for five thousand one hundred days men. Recruiting
commenced on the 11th day of July, the company was filled on the 12th,
went into camp on the 13th, was mustered into service on the 14th
and on the 15th and 16th the men were clothed, armed and equipped
throughout and ready to move on the 17th--just six days after the first
movement was made.

“Captain Sherman, says the Lawrence American (edited by Captain
Merrill, who was at Port Hudson in the Fourth Regiment), under
extraordinary difficulties, raised a company of nine months men,
enlisting himself as a private, from which he was promoted to a
Captaincy, and, as we personally know, no braver or more faithful
officer has left our city. Always attentive to the needs of his men,
and even when weak and emaciated with sickness, as we saw him at Port
Hudson (in the 48th Massachusetts) leaving the hospital, against the
positive prohibition of the surgeon, to lead his men in the assault. He
was brevetted Major for ‘gallant and meritorious services.’”

THE ROSTER




PREFACE TO THE ROSTER


The historian does not hold himself responsible for the absolute
accuracy of the regimental roster as errors may have unavoidably crept
in. But the roster was carefully compiled from the records kept at the
State House and is a complete copy of such records.

  THE HISTORIAN.




DESERTIONS


The large number of desertions from some of the companies is accounted
for by the fact that the recruits were brought to camp by agents of the
cities who paid bounties as soon as the recruits were mustered into the
United States service.

The officers of those companies objected to accepting such recruits,
prophesying that many of them would desert, but the objections were
overruled and the officers were compelled to accept them.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
